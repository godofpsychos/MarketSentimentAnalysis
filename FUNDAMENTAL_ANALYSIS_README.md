# ðŸ“ˆ Fundamental Analysis Integration

## Overview
I've successfully integrated a comprehensive fundamental analysis system into your Market Sentiment Analysis application. This feature provides reliability scores, future growth scope, and overall investment grades directly in the stock containers.

## What's New

### ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive Score Calculator
**Location**: `FundamentalAnalysis/indicators/fundamental_score_calculator.py`

This calculator provides:
- **Reliability Score (0-100)**: Based on financial stability, debt levels, liquidity, and profitability consistency
- **Growth Scope (0-100)**: Evaluates future growth potential using revenue growth, earnings growth, and sustainable growth rates  
- **Valuation Score (0-100)**: Assesses if the stock is attractively priced using P/E, P/B, P/S ratios and DCF analysis
- **Overall Investment Grade**: A+ to F letter grade with buy/sell/hold recommendations
- **Risk Assessment**: Low/Medium/High risk classification

### ðŸ“Š Frontend Integration
**Location**: `frontend/src/FundamentalScoreCard.js`

The fundamental analysis now appears in the **bottom left** of each stock container with:
- Color-coded progress bars for each score component
- Overall grade badge (A+ to F)
- Investment recommendation (Buy/Hold/Sell)
- Risk level indicator
- Animated score bars with modern styling

### ðŸ”§ API Endpoints
**Backend**: `backend_api.py`

New endpoints:
- `/api/fundamental-scores/{stock_symbol}` - Get complete analysis for one stock
- `/api/fundamental-scores-batch` - Get scores for multiple stocks
